* hex_to_decimal and decimal_to_hex do not understand negative numbers
       (treats as unsigned)
  (note some GMP funcs are also a bit lose: mpz_get_si, mpz_get_ui)

* the compare functions return a true or false
  perhaps the other functions should not return the err_code,
  but rather pass an &err in?

* multiplication is slow; division is very slow
  (maybe revisit "Seminumerical Algorithms")

* would there be an advantage to creating an abstract interface?
  - testing could wrap a real lib and compare results impl (GMP's mpz_t maybe?)

* make stack allocation plugable for embedded non-alloca environments
